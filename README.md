# MiniBank System

**MiniBank System** is a beginner-friendly, console-based banking application built in Java.  
What started as a simple user login system has now evolved into a fully functional banking simulation, allowing users to log in, view balances, deposit money, and make secure withdrawals.

##Features

- User Authentication  
  Validates login credentials using a `HashMap`

- Account Management  
  View current account balance  
  Deposit money 
  Withdraw money

- Menu-Driven Navigation  
  Easy-to-follow banking menu using `switch` and `while` loop

- Encapsulation  
  Protects sensitive data using `private` access modifiers

## Technologies Used

- Java
- HashMap (for user and balance management)
- Scanner (for reading user input)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## What I Learned

- Designing interactive console applications
- Implementing secure user login logic
- Managing state with collections
- Validating user input
- Structuring modular Java programs
